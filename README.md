How to test?  
Step 1: Get data for test:  
&nbsp;We use ER random graphs generated by Sample.py for test.  
&nbsp;Two ways to get the data for test:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Run Sample.py, but it will take too much time.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Download from [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aq8XcGokRpkl_RaY8OO1qR49kesg?e=w1cdcj) and unzip it.  
Step 2: Run Boruvka.py to test, then the results will be saved in result.csv
